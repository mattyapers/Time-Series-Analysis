Election-Related Pages
In addition to the candidate pages, consider analyzing traffic to pages related to the elections themselves and key issues that were prominent during those times:

Pages for each election (e.g., "2008 United States presidential election", "2012 United States presidential election", etc.).
Key political and election issues (e.g., "Healthcare reform in the United States", "United States foreign policy", "Climate change policy of the United States", "Immigration policy of Donald Trump", etc.) during the election years.
Political party pages (e.g., "Democratic Party (United States)", "Republican Party (United States)").
